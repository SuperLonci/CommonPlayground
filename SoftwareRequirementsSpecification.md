## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Vision
Inspired by carpool coordination services like ‘BlaBlaCar’ or ‘Mitfahrzentrale’ we want to build an application to coordinate game sessions. We plan to create a platform for people who are looking for other people to play games with. Covering online multiplayer games, tabletop, pen and paper or regular board games we want to provide a kind of bulletin board where people can state what they want to play, when and where they want to do it and how many people they are looking for. Others can then react to the postings and virtually join the play session to be connected by us so everyone can coordinate the actual play session together on a Common Playground.

## 3. Specific Requirements

### 3.1 Functionality

    - Use Cases/Übersichtsseiten Erklärung

#### 3.1.1 Posting a session
This feature is the essential one of our project. The user gets the possibility to post a session. Therefore, he has to select a game and also set the time when he wants to play. Later on, when we also implemented offline games, he has to set a location, too.

#### 3.1.2 Finding and joining a session
There is also the possibility to join an existing game session. Therefore, the user can find a session by tags and then by pressing a button join the session by another player. Later on, finding a session will be provided by geolocalization that the users can search for a session in a specific area.

#### 3.1.3 Getting in touch
There must be the possibility that two people who want to play together can communicate with each other. At first, we want to implement that when a user post a session, he has to enter his mail address. The player who joins the session gets than the possibility to contact the first user. Later on, when we will have implemented profiles, then there will be another way to communicate with each other.

#### 3.1.4 Manage your sessions and leave a session
The app provides the user with a seperate page view where he gets an overview of all sessions he posted or he joined in. Here, the user can see who joined his posted session. The user gets also the possibility to delete a session he posted or to leave a session he joined in.

#### 3.1.5 Logging in
Later on, the app will provide the possibility to register and log in. This will also make the usability easier when a user wants to manage his sessions, post or join a session because he doesn't have to enter his mail address every time.

#### 3.1.6 Presenting yourself and checking out others
With the possibility to log in there comes another functionality, the profile. Every user will have his one profile where he can write some informations about hisself. Because of the privacy policy in Europe, the user has the possibility to only write those information he wants other people to see. Owing to the profile, users can also check out other players and learn e.g. the favorite games about the user.

#### 3.1.7 Rating users and managing friends
After a session, the app provides the users with the possibility to rate the other participants. When they found an interesting person they can also add them to there friend list which also has a seperate page view.

#### 3.1.8 Ban users and deleting posts
There are also some functionalities for the admin. He will get the possibility to ban users and to delete any posts.
